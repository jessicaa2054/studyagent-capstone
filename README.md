Students often struggle to organize their study schedules, track syllabus progress, and plan revisions efficiently. StudyAgent is an automated multi-agent system that generates personalized study plans, summarizes notes into compact capsules, and manages reminders for upcoming tasks. Using LLM-powered planner and summarizer agents, a simple memory system, and a custom calendar tool, StudyAgent helps students save time and stay consistent with their study goals. This project demonstrates multi-agent orchestration, tool usage, memory handling, and basic observability.
